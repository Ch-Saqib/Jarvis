**Jarvis-Like Project**
=====================

**Overview**
------------

This project aims to create a Jarvis-like AI assistant using various technologies such as natural language processing, machine learning, and web development. The project is built with a modular design, allowing for easy integration of new features and technologies.

**Dependencies**
--------------

### Poetry
We use Poetry as our package manager. You can install the dependencies by running:

```bash
poetry install
```

### Docker
The project includes a Dockerfile for building a Docker image. You can build the image by running:

```bash
docker build -t jarvis-like-image .
```

### Compose
We use Compose for managing multi-container Docker applications. You can start the containers by running:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

**Components**
--------------

### Deepgram SDK
The Deepgram SDK is used for speech recognition and transcription. It provides an API for converting audio files to text.

### FastAPI
FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.

### Jinja2
Jinja2 is a templating engine used for generating HTML templates dynamically.

### Groq
Groq is a query language used for querying and manipulating data.

### Uvicorn
Uvicorn is a Python web server built on top of uvloop and HTTP parser. It's designed to be fast and easy to use.

### Dockerfile
The Dockerfile is used to build a Docker image for the project. It installs the dependencies and sets the environment variables.

### docker-compose.yml
The `docker-compose.yml` file is used to manage the Docker containers. It defines the services and their dependencies.

**How it Works**
----------------

1. **Audio Recording**: The user records their audio using a microphone or uploads an audio file.
2. **Speech Recognition**: The Deepgram SDK is used to recognize the spoken words and transcribe them into text.
3. **Template Rendering**: The Jinja2 templating engine is used to render an HTML template with the transcribed text.
4. **Querying Data**: Groq is used to query and manipulate the data related to the user's query.
5. **API Response**: The FastAPI framework is used to generate a JSON response with the processed data.
6. **Presentation**: The JSON response is sent to the user's web interface, which is rendered using Jinja2.

**Getting Started**
-------------------

### Installation

To get started, simply clone the repository and install the dependencies using Poetry:

```bash
poetry install
```

### Running the App
To run the app, use Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up
```
